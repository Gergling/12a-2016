# 12a-2016

## Setup

You will need to download:
* git (make sure this runs on the command line or use a GUI client. Both are recommended)
* node

Clone the project (from the command line, if you're using a GUI, find the clone button and use the url):

```
git clone https://github.com/Gergling/12a-2016.git
```

To install:

```
npm install
```

To run the server:

```
npm start
```

Contact me if anything doesn't work.
