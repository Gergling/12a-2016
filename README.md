# 12a-2016

## Setup

You will need to download:
* git (make sure this runs on the command line or use a GUI client. Both are recommended)
* node

Clone the project (from the command line, if you're using a GUI, find the clone button and use the url):

```
git clone https://github.com/Gergling/12a-2016.git
```

To install:

```
npm install
```

To run the server:

```
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/. It should eventually load some nonsense, but you'll probably be able to discern that the otherwise-currently-broken-software is 'working'.

I installed these things so long ago that I don't remember any complications I might have had, so we'll have to do this together if you run into any issues.
